This is a MUD server intended to be a superset and clone of ISLAND by
Huw Davies and Richard Green, but also as a vehicle for the author,
Martin Keegan, to practise writing OCaml beyond his day job.

Initial bootstrapping assistance from Alistair Turnbull and Tom Wilkie.

The source comes with a few extracts from the ISLAND database; unfortunately
the rest of that material is copyrighted, and the existing test suite
depends on it. Neither is currently shipped.
